# Deep Learning Notebook Compilation

This is my personal notebook compilation of my self-taught Deep Learning subject. It covers how to use libraries like **Jupyter Notebook**, **NumPy**, **Keras** and **Tensorflow**, preferable language is **Python**.

## Covering

- Neural Networks & Deep Learning

- Improving Deep Neural Networks
  
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  
- Convolutional Neural Networks
  
- Sequence Models

## Build Document

Install node module `docpress` globally,

```bash
$ npm i -g docpress
```

To compile document (.md to .html),

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To serve as http (localhost:3000),

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

**(( ! ))** The compiled document is located in the `/html/` folder.
