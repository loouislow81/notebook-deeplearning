# Deep Learning Notebook Compilation

My personal self-taught Deep learning notebook compilation

## Build Document (.md to .html)

Install node module `docpress` to run globally,

```bash
$ npm i -g docpress
```

To compile document,

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To serve as http,

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

**(( ! ))** The compiled document is located in the `/html/` folder.

Happy Learning!
