# Deep Learning

This is my personal notebook compilation of my self-taught Deep Learning subject. It covers how to use libraries like **Jupyter Notebook**, **NumPy**, **Keras** and **Tensorflow**, preferable language is **Python**.

There are tons of **_terminologies_** that you do not understand, please search at Google.

#### Covering

- [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](chapter-1.md)

- [Improving Deep Neural Networks](chapter-2.md)
  
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](chapter-3.md)
  
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](chapter-4.md)
  
- [Sequence Models](chapter-5.md)
